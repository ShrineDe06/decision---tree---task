# Decision Tree — Scikit-learn on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates how to build and visualize a Decision Tree classifier using the Iris dataset with **scikit-learn** in Python.

## 🔍 Overview
- **Algorithm:** Decision Tree Classifier (from `sklearn.tree`)
- **Dataset:** Iris (loaded via `sklearn.datasets`)
- **Goal:** Classify iris flower species based on petal and sepal features

## 📁 Files
- `decision_tree.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation, model training, and visualization.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 📊 Output
The decision tree is trained on the dataset and visualized using `plot_tree()` from `sklearn`.

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to load data, train the model, and display the tree.

## 📌 Notes
This is a basic example for understanding how decision trees work. It can be extended with:
- Model evaluation (e.g., accuracy)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Exporting the tree graph as an image or PDF
